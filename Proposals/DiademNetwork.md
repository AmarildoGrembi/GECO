### What project are you building
We are creating an open source protocol on top of Ethereum, which enables the frictionless exchange of crypto-rewards for actions in real life. We connect the real world with blockchain, by providing an easy to use interface anyone, even without any technical knowledge can use.

### Why did you decide to build it
Today positive actions and accomplishments cannot be easily measured, proven and rewarded, as there is no technological connection and we need to rely on third parties.
People are fallible, they make mistakes and often people who provide the highest value are often rewarded the least or even overlooked altogether.

Usecases:
1. Employers have little to no guarantees that a freelancer or contractor will accomplish any work after they wire a pre-payment. And on the the other side of the table freelancers often donâ€™t get paid.
2. Sponsors of charities have no confidence how budgets are spent.
3. People haven't got enough motivation to change habits and behaviours.

### How long will it take
Gnosis integration will take one month

### How much funding are you requesting  
$10 000

### How did you hear about the GECO
Looking for progress of Gnosis ecosystem

### Others
We want to truly change the world and build a more fair and inclusive society by inspiring more good and social behaviour, by rewarding people who are the initiators of such behaviour by giving them easier access to recognition and financial support.
