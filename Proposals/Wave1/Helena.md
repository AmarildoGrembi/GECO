## Project Overview

### Project name

PM Interface 2.0

### Team members

Helena Team: Mark Ziade, Carlos Buendia, Rodrigo Ariza.

Helena (previously known as Frontier) is incubated at ConsenSys and currently spinning out and becoming an independent company.

### What project are you building

Our project is about building a Prediction Markets interface to make it easier and more appealing for corporations to use prediction markets internally and for startups to integrate Prediction Markets within their offerings.

We have deep experience working with the Apollo package and will be starting from there to upgrade and improve the Olympia interface. Our plan is to:

-   Implement 5-10 User Interface improvements to the existing interface based on feedback captured from users and from Gnosis, such as: adding market creation dates, showing the details of profits and losses for each market, improving chart feature and layout to make it easier to read and more visible, adding notifications for market creation and resolution, adding the ability to suggest markets and upvote suggestions and other
    
-   Implement 5-10 new interactive and personalized features on the interface based on user needs and feedback from Gnosis, such as: user profiles, ability to comment and engage in public forum discussions about specific markets, historical performance per user, and other
    
-   Build an Admin dashboard with 5-10 key features based on user needs and feedback from Gnosis, where Admins can easily manage markets through new features, such as: creating markets, resolving markets, refunding markets, encrypting markets, and other
    

  

### Why did you decide to build it

Helena is building a global institutional crypto research network leveraging blockchain curation and crowdsourcing protocols to improve research value and optimize cost. One of those protocols are Prediction Markets as they allow:

-   Analysts to have a skin in the game and be held accountable while making money
    
-   Funds and corporations to efficiently quantify research signals and crowdsource information
    
-   Objectively track analyst performance over time
    

Our goal at Helena is to integrate Prediction Markets as a core feature of our research platform for analysts and funds to use.

On the path to doing so, we have been testing and piloting specific Prediction Markets use cases with our analysts and also within ConsenSys. In fact, we have been working with Gnosis for more than 1 year. We are the first to use the Apollo package and the first to run a Mainnet Prediction Markets tournament.

The Blockchain Research Prediction Markets pilot we ran at ConsenSys last December proved to be very successful:

-   49 Participants registered their wallets to Helena PM
    
-   40 Participants participated in at least 1 market
    
-   11.5 median number of participants per market
    
-   12 markets created
    
-   11 markets resolved
    
-   1 market disputed and cancelled - refunds were issued to participants
    

We also captured and are still capturing a lot of valuable feedback from users on how to improve the User Interface and User Experience. In addition, the pilot allowed us to deeply understand the product and come up with new ideas to improve it.

Helena is currently spinning out of ConsenSys. However, as ConsenSys is moving to ConsenSys 2.0 with increased Radical Accountability and a focus on an Innovation Culture and Incentivization Tools, Prediction Markets are very well positioned to be a core tool of ConsenSys 2.0 - we already spoke to Joseph Lubin and he is very interested in that. This constitute a great pilot use case for Helena to test the new interface we aim to build with the support of GECO.

Last but not least, the development work we will be doing with the support of GECO will allow us to create an interface we can integrate in our research platform to fulfill our Helena roadmap, while also offering the same interface for other startups who are interested in offering Prediction Markets as a service or integrate it within their offerings, therefore benefiting the whole community and contributing to the spread of Prediction Markets.

### How long will it take

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ND-RKPvGZjgNIoeUhp5doIQ38yJgxdZEsGVGQGfUsLlBiCHt22NGWb8aOl1VHJ9cUYVSh5GU7vwXmtheYRr1Zvd03J2gE2kXan-QBtc9e6B8nDOkfPdG4Z3esgEC9tF9Bt8NLR29)

The project needs 3 FTEs for 4 month of full-time work: 1 business / product lead, 1 back-end developer and 1 front-end developer.

-   The business / product lead will be responsible of capturing feedback from users and Gnosis team, defining the user stories, determining the features to build, managing the project and customer testing and validation
    
-   The back-end developer will be responsible of all back-end architecture design and development work
    
-   The front-end developer will be responsible of all front-end interface design and development work
    

Since we will be working on it 50% of our time on a daily basis, the actual duration will be 8 months.

**For now, are applying for Phase 1. We will be applying for Phases 2 and 3 in March**

**For Phase 1 of the proposal, “User Interface Improvements”, the estimated time would be 2 months working 50% of the time. Note: we are flexible and open to suggestions.**

### How much funding are you requesting

We will need $120,000 in funding for the full proposal, for:

-   3 FTEs (1 business / product lead, 1 back-end developer and 1 front-end developer), 50% of time over 8 months
    
-   Infrastructure Cost
    
-   Part-time designer support
    

**For now, are applying for Phase 1. We will be applying for Phases 2 and 3 in March**

**For Phase 1 of the proposal, “User Interface Improvements”, the budget would be $30K. Note: we are flexible and open to suggestions.**

### How did you hear about the GECO

We heard about GECO from the Gnosis team and through Medium and Twitter.

## Your Proposal

### Project description

Helena is the global institutional crypto research platform, connecting professional crypto research analysts to funds and corporations. Helena uniquely differentiates itself by offering an independent platform built on a blockchain protocol empowering analysts to competitively distribute research while enabling funds and corporations to curate analyst quality.

Prediction Markets are at the core of the Helena Value Proposition as they allow:

-   Analysts to have a skin in the game and be held accountable while making money
    
-   Funds and corporations to efficiently quantify research signals and crowdsource information
    
-   Objectively track analyst performance over time
    

Our goal at Helena is to integrate Prediction Markets as a core feature of our research platform for analysts and funds to use.

The Helena Research Platform Prediction Markets feature would work as follow:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FV-i268sZxvauaW_LMOzERYVlQ_QGbk8omN-8z9a5CFMy98hyYu5z7lfbPKMUaQobtknYO7sITymuSD-6TQP6NRsJ2JHbCNDJxixCQCGh0tHrKhwm4meWcqsi4EYISUQzTg8igWN)

Our 3-step approach to build the Prediction Markets feature at Helena is the following;

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uAbgX5V_pU0_YymlEX81FB9_8sJob-XB-vHrlsvUaAKFnnFbq3bmFsZq4_5UNnv3w1EJZKcO9o0yTKcrWcExbD3lAnanJxpNBTZTIq9_maJCDk5pUomaINorFb1jyul5doIJda42)

Steps A, B and C are iterative. We have been focusing heavily on Steps A and B during 2018. We ran two pilots, one based on an Excel MVP with 5 analysts and the other one based on the Apollo package with 49 ConsenSys employees. Both pilots proved to be very successful.

Our next step now is to tackle Step C. But before doing so, we need to improve the Prediction Markets interface and build some new interface functionalities. This is why we are applying to GECO.

The GECO proposal is the first Goal of our integration roadmap defined below:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VKWUyUh1XM0ozqOg4ShdQbN9asipynW-YGlg4lLe71WP8qTVZVOCU6KgkWuavK1sofsN03gMSKAgAyodwODSDzQL7hhoMQA4jmu4hiTMY4aF4pexLxtjbswl5l9Fuj3VflktS49u)

-   **Goal 1: PM Interface - GECO Scope**
    

     -   Implement 5-10 User Interface improvements to the existing interface based on feedback captured from users and from Gnosis, such as: adding market creation dates, showing the details of profits and losses for each market, improving chart feature and layout to make it easier to read and more visible, adding notifications for market creation and resolution, adding the ability to suggest markets and upvote suggestions and other
    
    -   Implement 5-10 new interactive and personalized features on the interface based on user needs and feedback from Gnosis, such as: user profiles, ability to comment and engage in public forum discussions about specific markets, historical performance per user, and other
    
    -   Build an Admin dashboard with 5-10 key features based on user needs and feedback from Gnosis, where Admins can easily manage markets through new features, such as: creating markets, resolving markets, refunding markets, encrypting markets, and other
    

-   Goal 2: Interface Integration within the Helena Platform
    

	-   Integration of PM interface within CMS (Helena’s research distribution platform)
    
	-   Add CMS specific features linking report generation to prediction markets generation
    
	-   Streamline user flow from CMS to PM Interface
    

-   Goal 3: Oracle Integration
    

	-   Market Study
	    
	-   Architecture Design
	    
	-   Oracle provider adaptor development
	    
	-   Admin dashboard integration
    

-   Goal 4: Automated Compensation
    

	-   Network connector via bridges
	    
	-   Usage on secondary chain, Payment on mainnet
	    
	-   Bounty creation
	    
	-   Scoreboard compensation using bounty
	    

	-   Goal 5: Conditional Predictions
	    

	-   User Interface
	    
	-   Adapt PM 2.0 to back-end
	    
	-   Other
    

The Goal 1 development work we will be doing with the support of GECO will allow us to create an interface we can integrate in our research platform to fulfill our Helena roadmap (Step C), while also offering the same interface for other startups who are interested in offering Prediction Markets as a service or integrate it within their offerings, therefore benefiting the whole community and contributing to the spread of Prediction Markets. Our objective would be about building a Prediction Markets interface to make it easier and more appealing for corporations to use prediction markets internally and for startups to integrate Prediction Markets within their offerings.

Given our experience setting up and running Helena Prediction Markets within ConsenSys, we are very well positioned to work on that for the following reasons:

-   We are sibling spokes :) Gnosis spun out from ConsenSys and Helena is currently spinning out
    
-   We have a long term and strong relationship with Gnosis, which started more than 1 year ago
    
-   Prediction Markets are a core component of the Helena Value Proposition and we have a long term commitment to this project, beyond GECO
    
-   We are big believers of Prediction Markets and we want to contribute to the spread and usage of Prediction Markets in the community
    
-   We have deep knowledge of the Apollo package - we were the first to use it and the first to run the tournament on Mainnet
    
-   We have deep understanding of the user experience and user needs, especially through the pilot we ran at ConsenSys in December
    
-   We have strong interest from Joseph Lubin to use Prediction Markets for ConsenSys 2.0
    

### Features

For each of the phases, we will be starting from the user needs. We will develop the user stories for the specific phase, prioritize the features, and select 5-10 to implement. All of this will be done based on user needs and feedback from Gnosis.

We have provided below **examples** of what the features to be implemented for each phase can be and how we are thinking about requirements and specifications for each.

#### Requirements

**Phase 1: UI Improvements**

This phase of development is set to improve the current interface of Olympia, given the feedback received from the tournament completed last month. A successful phase 1 will include the creation of the following items:

-   Report including user stories based on the feedback received, and selecting 5-10 features to implement
    
-   Wireframes and design of the new iteration to be developed
    
-   UI modifications based on the previous report
    

Features to be implement would include for example:

-   A better chart visualization
    
-   User notifications for new markets
    
-   Market suggestions
    

-   Description: Additional page to the olympia solution, making participants able to propose and vote-signal new prediction markets.
    
-   Rationale: Those Helena users that want to predict the outcome of a future event should be able to propose a new event to be included, and vote for the topics they are mostly interested in.
    
-   Functional requirements:
    

	-   Users are able to propose a new market
	    
	-   Users are able to see the different proposals created, tagged by topic
	    
	-   Users are able to upvote markets
    

**Phase 2: New Personalized and Interactive Features for Users**

This phase focuses on the development of generic new infrastructure useful for Helena and any other third party to integrate Olympia pm. This can include the following modules, for example:

-   User Profiles
    

	-   Description: A generic service complementing the current Olympia features, that allows users to have enriched profiles
	    
	-   Rationale: Third parties using Olympia will need to adapt the current generic database to their user base, as its application will be restricted to their users. This is the case of Helena. This module enables to create profiles inside Olympia, while keeping the possibility of using pseudonyms.
	    
	-   Functional requirements
	    
		
		-   An Admin can decide whether the Olympia application will be personalized or anonymous
		    
		-   A User is able to sign up if his / her keys have been whitelisted
		    
		-   A User is able to sign in with his / her ethereum account if his / her keys have been whitelisted
		    
		-   A User is able to see his / her account information and profile
		    
		-   A User is able to modify his / her personal information
	    

-   Comments
	    

	-   Description: Inclusion of public forum comments on different prediction markets, as an additional feature to the market page.
	    
	-   Rationale: In specific applications, there is value in having users commenting on markets and engaging in public discussions
	    
	-   Functional requirements
	    
		
		-   A user can comment on a market
		    
		-   A user can reply to a comment on a market
		    
		-   A user can submit a justification for a certain prediction
		    
		-   A user can like a comment on a market
		    


**Phase 3: Admin Dashboard**

-   Description: An admin interface enabling the Admin to directly create, resolve or refund markets, among other things
    
-   Rationale: We discovered pm-scripts were useful to create and resolve markets abstracting from Smart Contracts and backend, but they include an important risk of committing an error on the JSON file. An admin interface can avoid this source of risks.
    
-   Functional requirements:
    

	-   An Admin is able to visualize all proposed markets
	    
	-   An Admin is able to create a new market
	    
	-   An Admin is able to resolve a market, selecting the outcome
	    
	-   An Admin is able to refund users
    

#### Specifications (examples)

#### Market Suggestions

In order to create market suggestions, Helena will develop a simple external module, making use of the previously defined user service. This module will include:

-   A Backend service: providing an API and storing the information in a database. This backend service will require user authentication, by checking the JWT provided by the previous service.
    
-   A Frontend page: complementing the current pm-ui
    

  

*Technical Stack: Typescript / NodeJS / MongoDB (Backend), React/Redux (Frontend)*

#### User Profiles

This service will be developed as an external to the current generic pm-db interface, allowing crud operations on user information. Given that the information required will have personal values, this module also includes role based access control on the personal data. This is accomplished through the usage of two submodules:

1.  Auth Service: A dumb module connected to pm-db, which is able to identify which users have been whitelisted from pm-smart-contracts, and generate a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) giving them access to use the user service.
    
2.  pm-users: A CRUD module links ethereum accounts to personal information and serves it via a REST API.
    

This services will define the full lifecycle of the service, that can be divided into three different stages:

1.  Application / Sign up: Users are able to submit a form with their ethereum account, and their personal details. This information is submitted to the user service as an application
    

In case the participant is accepted, he will receive an amount of olympia tokens. This will generate an event that will be accounted by pm-db, and can be considered as a whitelisted user.

2.  Authentication / Log in: Users can now log in by signing a message with their ethereum keys, and sending it to the Auth service. This service will recover the account, and check if it has been whitelisted. In case it is, it will issue a new token for the user.
    
3.  Data retrieval: With the token generated from the Auth service, the user is able now to access profile information from the User Service

*Technical Stack: Typescript / NodeJS / MongoDB (Backend), React/Redux (Frontend)*

#### Comments

The comments feature is done through a reactive database, and using the user and notification services to notify users.

  

*Technical Stack: Typescript / NodeJS / MongoDB (Backend), React/Redux (Frontend)*

#### Admin Dashboard

This Dashboard will essentially create a user interface for the current pm-scripts, auto-generating the specified JSONs.

*Technical Stack: Typescript / NodeJS / MongoDB (Backend), React/Redux (Frontend)*

### Others

Helena is very interested in working closely with Gnosis on having a coordinated marketing and communication campaign.

In addition, we are started to explore, with ConsenSys Legal, the viability of Prediction Markets in the US and have a structure in mind to get a no action letter from CFTC. We will be detailing this further once we spin out and get our own legal counsel. Knowing that Gnosis is already exploring this area, we believe there could be strong synergies there.
