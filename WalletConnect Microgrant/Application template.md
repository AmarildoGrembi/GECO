# Microgrant Application
_This is a guideline on how to apply for a WalletConnect microgrant_


### Dapp name
> Name of your project and provide an URL to access it

### Team members
> Name your team members 

### GitHub Repo
> Link to your GitHub Repo

### What is your Dapp about?
> Short summary/abstract of your project. What can a user do with your dapp?

### Why did you decide to build it?
> Short summary of your motivation

### How big is your user base?
> How many users does your Dapp have? How many active users does your Dapp have?

### How long will you need to integrate a Gnosis Safe compatible WalletConnect integration?
> Estimation of how long you will need to build the integration

### Does your Dapp use message signing?
> The Gnosis Safe is a smart contract wallet. That means there is no single private key that can be used to sign messages. If your dapp requires message signing, please map out a high level plan on how you want to make it compatible with the Safe. We are working on contract signature support via EIP1271 and hope to be able to have it live by the beginning of Q4 on Android and iOS.
